# Car Insurance Claims Classifier

## Background and Overview

An unknown car insurance company has released its annual data, which includes detailed information on policyholder's demographics, vehicle specifications, driving history, and whether a claim was filed. This project leverages a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a policyholder filing a claim based on these attributes. Additionally, the project identifies the key factors influencing claim likelihood, providing valuable insights that can enhance pricing strategies, improve risk assessment, and streamline the insurance application process through automation.

This project will enhance the company's performance in the following key areas:
- **Risk Assessment** 
- **Marketing Strategy**
- **Cost Reduction**

















## Recommendations:
- Advise the marketing team to look to tailor advertisements and lower rates towards potential customers with more driving experience and newer vehicles
- The company can offer varied rates for driving safety (assessed via telematics) targetted at policyholders with lower driving experience
  - This does two things:
    - Rewards safer drivers with lower premiums, benefiting both the driver and the company by retaining low risk policyholders
    - Leverages overconfidence (a common cognitive bias) in less safe drivers, allowing the company to justify higher premiums for those with lower driving experience, ultimately reducing the risk of taking on high-risk policyholders
